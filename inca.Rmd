The Interchain Adaptation (INCA) algorithm of Craiu et al. (2009) is an extension of the Adaptive Metropolis (AM) algorithm of Haario et al. (2001). Craiu et al. (2009) refer to INCA as inter-chain adaptation and inter-chain adaptive MCMC. INCA uses parallel chains that are independent, except that they share the adaptive component, and this sharing speeds convergence. Since parallel chains are a defining feature of INCA, in the <span class="pack">LaplacesDemon</span> package this algorithm works only with the function for high performance computing, <span class="func">LaplacesDemon.hpc</span>, not <span class="func">LaplacesDemon</span>.

INCA has two algorithm specifications: `Adaptive` is the iteration in which it becomes adaptive, and `Periodicity` is the frequency in iterations of adaptation.

As with AM, the proposal covariance matrix is set equal to the historical (or sample) covariance matrix. Ample pre-adaptive iterations are recommended (Craiu et al., 2009), and initial values should be dispersed to aid in discovering multimodal marginal posterior distributions. After adaptation begins, INCA combines the historical covariance matrices from all parallel chains during each adaptation. Each chain learns from experience as in AM, and in INCA, each chain also learns from the other parallel chains.

Solonen et al. (2012) found a dramatic reduction in the number of iterations to convergence when INCA used 10 parallel chains, compared against a single-chain AM algorithm. Similar improvements have been noted in the <span class="pack">LaplacesDemon</span> package, though more time is required per iteration.

The <span class="func">Gelman.Diagnostic</span> is recommended by Craiu et al. (2009) to determine when the parallel chains have stopped sharing different information about the target distributions. The exchange of information between chains decreases as the number of iterations increases.

This implementation of INCA uses a server function that is built into LaplacesDemon.hpc. If the connection to this server fails, then the user must kill the process and then close all open connections with the <span class="func">closeAllConnections</span> function.

Since INCA is an adaptive algorithm, the final algorithm should be Random-Walk Metropolis (RWM).
