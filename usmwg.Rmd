The Updating Sequential Metropolis-within-Gibbs (USMWG) algorithm is the non-adaptive version of the USAMWG algorithm, and is used for final sampling when updating state-space models (SSMs).

For example, suppose a time-series of daily values was fit with the SAMWG algorithm, and SMWG may have been used for final samples. Let's also suppose the last day in the model sample was a Monday, and that one-step ahead forecasts are produced, so the model predicted Tuesday. After the actual value for Tuesday is known, it may be included in the model. Using USAMWG, the latest Tuesday is filtered and Wednesday is forecast, while the days of the original model sample are not estimated again. USMWG may then be used for final samples.
