Preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) was introduced originally as the PIA algorithm in Beskos et al. (2008), and differs only slightly from Random-Walk Metropolis (RWM). The proposal is a first-order autoregressive process, rather than a centered random-walk. The pCN algorithm has an acceptance probability that is invariant to dimension, making pCN useful for large-dimensional models.

pCN has one algorithm specification, `beta`, which is the autoregressive parameter in (0,1).

As with RWM, the target acceptance rate is 23.4%. pCN seems to perform well only with an identity matrix as the proposal covariance matrix.

Since pCN is not adaptive, it is suitable as a final algorithm.
