The Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis (DRAM) algorithm is merely the combination of both Delayed Rejection Metropolis (DRM) and Adaptive Metropolis (AM) (Haario, Laine, Mira, and Saksman 2006). DRAM has been demonstrated to be robust in extreme situations where DRM or AM fail separately. Haario et al. (2006) present an example involving ordinary differential equations in which least squares could not find a stable solution, and DRAM did well.

DRAM has two algorithm specifications: `Adaptive` is the iteration in which DRAM becomes adaptive, and `Periodicity` is the frequency in iterations of adaptation.

The DRAM algorithm is useful to assist AM when the acceptance rate is low. As an alternative, the Adaptive-Mixture Metropolis (AMM) is an extension of the AM algorithm that includes a mixture of proposals, and one mixture component has a small proposal standard deviation to assist in overcoming initially low acceptance rates. If DRAM is used for adaptation, then the final algorithm should be Random-Walk Metropolis (RWM).
