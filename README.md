# MCMC Algorithms

Raw files for a document providing a list of mcmc algorithm descriptions. I take no credit for this; they were found on the now-defunct website for the (original) LaplacesDemon package in R, which has since been resurrected [here](https://github.com/LaplacesDemonR/LaplacesDemon). I thought it was a nice overview and comparison of techniques, so created this as a reference in case others might also. [link to doc](https://m-clark.github.io/docs/ld_mcmc/)
